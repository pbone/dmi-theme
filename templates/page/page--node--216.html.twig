/**
 * @file
 * Zurb Foundations's theme implementation to display a single page.
 *
 * Available variables:
 *
 * General utility variables:
 * - base_path: The base URL path of the Drupal installation. Will usually be
 *   "/" unless you have installed Drupal in a sub-directory.
 * - is_front: A flag indicating if the current page is the front page.
 * - logged_in: A flag indicating if the user is registered and signed in.
 * - is_admin: A flag indicating if the user has permission to access
 *   administration pages.
 *
 * Site identity:
 * - front_page: The URL of the front page. Use this instead of base_path when
 *   linking to the front page. This includes the language domain or prefix.
 * - logo: The url of the logo image, as defined in theme settings.
 * - linked_logo: The logo image, linked to <front>.
 * - site_name: The name of the site. This is empty when displaying the site
 *   name has been disabled in the theme settings.
 * - linked_site_name: The name of the site that also links to <front>.
 * - site_slogan: The slogan of the site. This is empty when displaying the site
 *   slogan has been disabled in theme settings.
 * - hide_site_name: A flag indicating if the site name has been toggled off on
 *   the theme settings page. If hidden, the "visually-hidden" class is added
 *   to make the site name visually hidden, but still accessible.
 * - hide_site_slogan: A flag indicating if the site slogan has been toggled off
 *   on the theme settings page. If hidden, the "visually-hidden" class is
 *   added to make the site slogan visually hidden, but still accessible.
 *
 * Page content (in order of occurrence in the default page.html.twig):
 * - messages: Status and error messages. Should be displayed prominently.
 * - node: Fully loaded node, if there is an automatically-loaded node
 *   associated with the page and the node ID is the second argument in the
 *   page's path (e.g. node/12345 and node/12345/revisions, but not
 *   comment/reply/12345).
 *
 * Regions:
 * - page.meta_header
 * - page.header
 * - page.help
 * - page.highlighted
 * - page.content
 * - page.sidebar_first
 * - page.sidebar_second
 * - page.footer_first
 * - page.footer_middle
 * - page.footer_last
